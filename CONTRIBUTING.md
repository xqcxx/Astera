# Contributing to Astera

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Astera**! We welcome participation from developers of all experience levels, especially through the **Drips Wave Program**, a sprint-based open source contribution model that rewards meaningful contributions.

---

## 🌊 The Drips Wave Program

The Drips Wave Program is a structured, sprint-based initiative that:

- Defines a short contribution cycle (typically ~1 week)
- Has a shared reward pool tied to merged pull requests
- Tracks contribution points for transparent reward distribution
- Enables contributors to earn based on impact, not just activity

For more about Waves and how they work, visit the official docs: https://docs.drips.network/wave.

## 🧭 How to Find and Claim an Issue

1. Go to the **Issues** tab of this repository
2. Look for labels such as:
   - `good first issue`
   - `help wanted`
   - `wave`
3. Comment on the issue you want to work on using:

   ```text
   I'd like to work on this
   ```

   This lets maintainers know you're interested and prevents duplication of effort.

4. Wait for a maintainer to tag you or confirm assignment

## 🎯 Your First Contribution

New to open source or Astera? Follow this step-by-step walkthrough to make your first meaningful contribution.

### Step 1: Find a good first issue

Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are scoped to be achievable in a few hours.

Example: You find issue #223: "Add CONTRIBUTING.md first-time contributor guide"

### Step 2: Claim the issue

Comment on the issue:
```text
I'd like to work on this
```

A maintainer will confirm assignment. This prevents duplicate effort.

### Step 3: Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork via GitHub UI, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Astera.git
cd Astera

# Add upstream for easy syncing
git remote add upstream https://github.com/astera-hq/Astera.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### Step 4: Set up your environment

Follow the **Development Environment Setup** section below to install Rust,
Node.js, and other tools. If you plan to use Docker Compose locally, read
[docs/local-development.md](docs/local-development.md) first.

### Step 5: Make your change

**Example: Adding a unit test to the share token contract**

Open `contracts/share/src/lib.rs` and add:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_mint_increases_balance() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, ShareToken);
    let client = ShareTokenClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
    
    let user = Address::generate(&env);
    client.mock_all_auths().mint(&user, &100);
    
    assert_eq!(client.balance(&user), 100);
}
```

Or if you're updating frontend documentation:

Open `CONTRIBUTING.md` and add your walkthrough section (like this one).

### Step 6: Run tests and linting

```bash
# For contracts
cd contracts
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
cargo test

# For frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Ensure all checks pass before proceeding.

### Step 7: Commit your changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add contracts/share/src/lib.rs

# Commit with a clear, conventional message
git commit -m "test(share): add unit tests for token mint operation"
```

### Step 8: Push and open a pull request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Then:
1. Go to https://github.com/astera-hq/Astera
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** for your branch
3. Fill in the PR template with:
   - A clear summary of what you changed and why
   - Link the issue: `Closes #123`
   - Describe how you tested it
4. Click **"Create pull request"**

### Step 9: Respond to review feedback

A maintainer will review your PR within 1–3 business days. They may request changes. That's normal and part of learning!

- **Request Changes**: Fix the issue and push new commits to the same branch
- **Approved**: Your PR will be merged soon

## 🛠 Development Environment Setup

Before contributing, set up your environment as follows. If you are using
Docker Compose for local development, start with the
[Local Development Guide](docs/local-development.md). If you are using Windows,
please follow the [Windows/WSL2 Setup Guide](docs/windows-wsl-setup.md).
For a guide on how to interact with the contracts, see the [Smart Contract Interaction Guide](docs/interacting-with-contracts.md).

### Required Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rust + Cargo** | Build Soroban smart contracts | https://rustup.rs/ |
| **Stellar CLI** | Deploy/test contracts locally | https://developers.stellar.org/docs/ |
| **Node.js** (v20+) | Frontend development | https://nodejs.org/ |
| **Freighter Wallet** | Browser extension for signing transactions | https://freighter.app/ |

### Step-by-step Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Astera.git
cd Astera

# 2. Add upstream remote (for keeping your fork in sync)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/astera-hq/Astera.git

# 3. Install the Soroban WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 4. Build and test the smart contracts
cd contracts
cargo test
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# 5. Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env.local   # Edit with your contract IDs & network settings
npm install

# 6. Start the development server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Smart Contracts (Rust / Soroban)

All contract changes **must** include or update tests.

```bash
cd contracts
cargo test
```

Build for deployment:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

- Every public function must have at least one test covering the happy path.
- Edge cases (e.g. zero amounts, unauthorized callers, duplicate operations) should be covered.
- Tests live in `mod test` blocks at the bottom of each contract's `lib.rs`.

### Frontend (TypeScript / Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint      # ESLint
npm run build     # Type-check + production build
```

- Ensure `npm run lint` passes with no errors before opening a PR.
- Ensure `npm run build` succeeds (catches TypeScript errors).

## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### Rust (Smart Contracts)

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Formatter** | `cargo fmt` — run before every commit |
| **Linter** | `cargo clippy` — no warnings allowed |
| **`#![no_std]`** | All contracts must be `no_std` compatible |
| **Naming** | `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types/enums |
| **Error handling** | Use `panic!("descriptive message")` for contract errors; keep messages concise |
| **Events** | Use `symbol_short!` for event topics; publish events for all state-changing operations |
| **Storage keys** | Define all keys in the `DataKey` enum |
| **Auth** | Always call `.require_auth()` on the relevant `Address` before mutating state |
| **Constants** | Use `const` for fixed values (e.g. `DEFAULT_YIELD_BPS`, `SECS_PER_YEAR`) |

### TypeScript (Frontend)

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Formatter** | Prettier (runs automatically via `lint-staged` on commit) |
| **Linter** | ESLint with `eslint-config-next` and `@typescript-eslint` |
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 App Router — use `'use client'` directive only when needed |
| **State** | Zustand for global state (`lib/store.ts`); React state for local UI |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS utility classes; follow existing `brand-*` design tokens |
| **Naming** | `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for functions/variables |
| **Imports** | Use `@/` path alias (e.g. `@/lib/store`, `@/components/Navbar`) |
| **Types** | Define shared types in `lib/types.ts`; prefer `interface` over `type` for objects |
| **Contract calls** | All Soroban interaction builders go in `lib/contracts.ts` |
| **SDK helpers** | Conversion/formatting utilities go in `lib/stellar.ts` |

### General

- Keep files focused — one component or module per file.
- Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.
- Do not commit `.env.local` or secret keys.
- Use English for all code comments and documentation.

## 🧾 Branch Naming Guidelines

Please use the following format for feature or fix branches:

```text
feat/short-description
fix/short-description
docs/short-description
```

Examples:

- `feat/add-invoice-support`
- `fix/api-endpoint-typo`
- `docs/update-api-docs`

---

## 📜 Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
type(scope?): short description
```

Where the `type` is one of:

| Type | Meaning |

test(pool): add co-funding edge case tests
```

## 📋 Changelog

This project maintains a `CHANGELOG.md` following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Releases are versioned using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). When opening a PR that introduces a user-facing change, please ensure the change is reflected in the `Unreleased` section of `CHANGELOG.md` under the appropriate category (`Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, or `Security`).

Release notes are generated automatically from conventional commits using `git-cliff` when a version tag (`v*`) is pushed.

## 🤖 Dependabot PRs

Dependabot checks the Rust workspace, frontend npm dependencies, and GitHub
Actions workflows for dependency updates. It opens pull requests with existing
area labels so maintainers can route them quickly:

- `smart-contract` and `devops` for Cargo workspace updates
- `frontend` and `devops` for frontend npm updates
- `devops` and `tooling` for GitHub Actions updates

When reviewing a Dependabot PR:

1. Prioritize security updates and runtime dependency updates before tooling-only changes.
2. Confirm the affected area by checking the labels and changed lockfiles.
3. Run the relevant local checks from the testing section above.
4. Merge only one dependency update PR at a time when failures would be hard to isolate.

---

## 📋 Pull Request Process

### Before Opening a PR

1. **Sync your fork** with the latest upstream `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. **Run all checks locally**:
   ```bash
   # Contracts
   cd contracts && cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy && cargo test

   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run build
   ```
3. **Ensure your branch is clean** — no unrelated changes, no merge commits.
