## 🎯 Your First Contribution

New to open source or Astera? Follow this step-by-step walkthrough to make your first meaningful contribution.

### Step 1: Find a good first issue

Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are scoped to be achievable in a few hours.

Example: You find issue #223: "Add CONTRIBUTING.md first-time contributor guide"

### Step 2: Claim the issue

Comment on the issue:
```text
I'd like to work on this
```

A maintainer will confirm assignment. This prevents duplicate effort.

### Step 3: Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork via GitHub UI, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Astera.git
cd Astera

# Add upstream for easy syncing
git remote add upstream https://github.com/astera-hq/Astera.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### Step 4: Set up your environment

Follow the **Development Environment Setup** section below to install Rust, Node.js, and other tools.

### Step 5: Make your change

**Example: Adding a unit test to the share token contract**

Open `contracts/share/src/lib.rs` and add:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_mint_increases_balance() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, ShareToken);
    let client = ShareTokenClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
    
    let user = Address::generate(&env);
    client.mock_all_auths().mint(&user, &100);
    
    assert_eq!(client.balance(&user), 100);
}
```

Or if you're updating frontend documentation:

Open `CONTRIBUTING.md` and add your walkthrough section (like this one).

### Step 6: Run tests and linting

```bash
# For contracts
cd contracts
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
cargo test

# For frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Ensure all checks pass before proceeding.

### Step 7: Commit your changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add contracts/share/src/lib.rs

# Commit with a clear, conventional message
git commit -m "test(share): add unit tests for token mint operation"
```

### Step 8: Push and open a pull request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Then:
1. Go to https://github.com/astera-hq/Astera
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** for your branch
3. Fill in the PR template with:
   - A clear summary of what you changed and why
   - Link the issue: `Closes #123`
   - Describe how you tested it
4. Click **"Create pull request"**

### Step 9: Respond to review feedback

A maintainer will review your PR within 1–3 business days. They may request changes. That's normal and part of learning!

- **Request Changes**: Fix the issue and push new commits to the same branch
- **Approved**: Your PR will be merged soon

---

## � Prerequisites

Before beginning local development, ensure you have the following tools installed. If you are on Windows, we strongly recommend using WSL2—see the [Windows/WSL2 Setup Guide](docs/windows-wsl-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### Required Tools

#### **Rust Toolchain**
- **Why**: Compiles Soroban smart contracts written in Rust to WebAssembly (WASM)
- **Install**: https://rustup.rs/
- **Verification**: `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`
- **What you'll use it for**: Building contracts, running tests, linting with Clippy, formatting with `rustfmt`

#### **Soroban CLI (Stellar CLI)**
- **Why**: Deploys contracts to testnet and mainnet; initializes and invokes contract functions
- **Install**: https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/stellar-cli
- **Verification**: `stellar --version`
- **What you'll use it for**: Deploying contracts, managing testnet accounts, invoking contract methods

#### **Node.js 20+**
- **Why**: Runs the Next.js 14 frontend and its build/test tools
- **Install**: https://nodejs.org/ (recommend using a version manager like `nvm` or `fnm`)
- **Verification**: `node --version` (should be v20.0.0 or higher) and `npm --version`
- **What you'll use it for**: Installing frontend dependencies, running linters (ESLint), building the frontend, running E2E tests (Playwright)

#### **Freighter Wallet**
- **Why**: Browser extension that signs transactions on the Stellar network; critical for local testing
- **Install**: https://www.freighter.app/
- **What you'll use it for**: Testing contract interactions, funding testnet accounts, signing deployment transactions

#### **Git** (optional but recommended)
- For syncing your fork, managing branches, and contributing changes
- Usually pre-installed on macOS and Linux

#### **Docker** (optional but recommended for rapid setup)
- For running the entire Astera stack (Stellar network, frontend, contracts, and mock services) with one command
- See [Rapid Local Development](#rapid-local-development-docker-compose) below

---

## 🚀 Local Setup

### Rapid Local Development (Docker Compose)

If you want a fully integrated development environment without manual setup, use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Astera.git
cd Astera

# Start the entire stack
docker-compose up -d
```

After the containers start:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Stellar RPC**: http://localhost:8000
- **Mock Services**: http://localhost:4000

To stop: `docker-compose down`

### Manual Setup (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer to set up dependencies manually or don't have Docker:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Astera.git
cd Astera

# Add upstream remote (for syncing with the main repository)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/astera-hq/Astera.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

#### 2. Set Up Rust Environment

```bash
# Install the WASM compilation target (required for Soroban contracts)
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Verify your Rust installation
cargo --version
rustc --version
```

#### 3. Build and Test Smart Contracts

```bash
# Navigate to contracts directory
cd contracts

# Run the full contract test suite
cargo test

# Build all contracts for deployment
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run linting checks (required before PRs)
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

The built WASM binaries will be in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`. You'll see:
- `invoice.wasm`
- `pool.wasm`
- `credit_score.wasm`
- `share.wasm`

#### 4. Set Up Frontend Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd ../frontend

# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your testnet contract IDs and network settings
# (You can leave these as placeholder values for initial development)

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### 5. Verify the Setup

Run the frontend development server to confirm everything is working:

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see the Astera home page. If you see build errors, check that:
- Node.js is v20 or higher: `node --version`
- All npm dependencies installed: `npm install`
- `.env.local` exists with required contract ID placeholders

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

Comprehensive testing is critical for smart contract correctness and security. You must run the appropriate tests for your changes before submitting a PR.

### Smart Contract Tests (Rust/Soroban)

All contract code **must** be tested. The test suite includes unit tests and fuzz tests.

#### Unit Tests

Run tests for all contracts:

```bash
cd contracts

# Run all tests in all contracts (invoice, pool, credit_score, share)
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific contract (example: invoice)
cd invoice
cargo test

# Run a specific test function
cargo test test_initialize

# Run tests with verbose output (shows individual test results)
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

**Testing requirements**:
- Every public function must have **at least one unit test** covering the happy path
- Edge cases (zero amounts, unauthorized callers, duplicate operations, boundary conditions) should be covered
- Tests live in `#[cfg(test)]` modules at the bottom of each contract's `lib.rs`
- All tests must pass before opening a PR

#### Fuzz Tests

Fuzz tests generate random inputs to find edge cases and crashes. They are defined in `contracts/<contract>/tests/fuzz_tests.rs`.

```bash
cd contracts/<contract>

# Run fuzz tests (defined in tests/fuzz_tests.rs)
cargo test --test fuzz_tests --verbose

# Run fuzz tests with a specific seed for reproducibility
PROPTEST_SEED=<seed> cargo test --test fuzz_tests
```

Fuzz tests are **required to pass** in the CI pipeline. If fuzzing finds an issue, fix the underlying code logic and re-run the tests.

#### Integration Tests

End-to-end tests that verify multiple contracts interacting together:

```bash
cd contracts

# Run all integration tests
cargo test --test integration_tests --verbose

# Run a specific integration test
cargo test --test integration_tests test_deposit_and_repay
```

The integration test file is located at `contracts/tests/integration_tests.rs`.

#### Building Contracts for Deployment

Before deployment or creating a PR with contract changes, verify the release build succeeds:

```bash
cd contracts

# Build all contracts for mainnet/testnet deployment
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Verify WASM binary sizes (required by CI; max 200 KB per contract)
for wasm in target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm; do
  SIZE=$(stat -f%z "$wasm" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$wasm" 2>/dev/null)
  echo "$wasm: $SIZE bytes"
  if [ "$SIZE" -gt 204800 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Binary too large for deployment"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

WASM binaries must not exceed **204,800 bytes** (200 KB). The CI pipeline checks this automatically.

#### Linting and Formatting

Before submitting contract changes, ensure linting and formatting pass:

```bash
cd contracts

# Format all code according to Rust style guidelines
cargo fmt

# Run Clippy linter (warnings are treated as errors in CI)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Check formatting without modifying files (useful in pre-commit hooks)
cargo fmt -- --check
```

All three commands must pass for contracts in a PR. The CI pipeline runs these checks automatically.

---

### Frontend Tests (TypeScript/Next.js)

#### Unit and Component Tests (Jest)

```bash
cd frontend

# Run all Jest tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- MyComponent.test.tsx

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

All new components and utilities should have test coverage. Check that:
- Tests exercise the happy path and error cases
- Component props are validated
- Hooks are tested with `renderHook`

#### Build and Type Checking

Ensure the production build succeeds (this catches TypeScript errors):

```bash
cd frontend

# Build the Next.js app (verifies TypeScript and Webpack compilation)
npm run build

# You should see output like: "✓ Linting and checking validity of types"
```

The build failing indicates a TypeScript error that must be fixed before PR submission.

#### Linting

```bash
cd frontend

# Run ESLint on all frontend code
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

All ESLint violations must be resolved. The CI pipeline fails if linting doesn't pass.

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Playwright tests verify the entire application flow from a user's perspective:

```bash
cd frontend

# Run all E2E tests in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI browser visible (useful for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run a specific E2E test
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/invest.spec.ts

# Run E2E tests in debug mode (step through with DevTools)
npx playwright test --debug
```

E2E tests are located in `frontend/e2e/`. They verify critical user flows such as:
- Connecting Freighter wallet
- Creating invoices
- Depositing into the pool
- Investing in invoice co-funding

E2E tests require a running Stellar testnet RPC (usually `localhost:8000` in development). See [Rapid Local Development](#rapid-local-development-docker-compose) to set up the local Stellar network.

---

### Running the Complete Test Suite Locally

Before opening a PR, run the full test suite locally to catch issues early:

```bash
# Contracts
cd contracts
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo test --test fuzz_tests
cargo test --test integration_tests
cargo audit  # Security dependency check

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:e2e  # (requires running Stellar network)
```

The CI pipeline runs a similar sequence. Passing locally means your PR is more likely to pass CI.

---

## 🚀 Deploying to Testnet

Once you've made changes to smart contracts and verified they pass all local tests, you can deploy them to the Soroban testnet to test in a live environment.

**Prerequisites for deployment**:
- Contracts build successfully: `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
- Stellar CLI installed and verified: `stellar --version`
- Freighter wallet with a testnet account

### Create a Testnet Account

If you don't have a testnet account, create one:

```bash
# Generate a new keypair
stellar keys generate --global deployer --network testnet

# Fund the account with testnet Lumens (XLM)
stellar keys fund deployer --network testnet
```

Verify the account is funded:

```bash
stellar account info deployer --network testnet
```

You should see a balance in XLM.

### Build Contracts for Deployment

```bash
cd contracts

# Build all contracts in release mode
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Verify WASM binaries exist
ls -lah target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm
```

You should see four `.wasm` files:
- `invoice.wasm`
- `pool.wasm`
- `credit_score.wasm`
- `share.wasm`

### Deploy Invoice Contract

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/invoice.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

This command will output a contract ID. **Note this ID** — you'll need it to initialize the contract and in environment variables. Example output:

```
Contract ID: CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD2KM
```

### Deploy Pool Contract

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/pool.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

Again, note the contract ID.

### Deploy Credit Score Contract

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/credit_score.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

### Initialize Contracts

Contract initialization sets up configuration and permissions. You need to initialize both the invoice and pool contracts.

#### Initialize Invoice Contract

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> \
  --pool <POOL_CONTRACT_ID>
```

Replace:
- `<INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID>` with the ID you received from the deploy step above
- `<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with your account public key (from `stellar keys show deployer --network testnet`)
- `<POOL_CONTRACT_ID>` with the pool contract ID from deployment

#### Initialize Pool Contract

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> \
  --usdc_token <USDC_TOKEN_ID> \
  --invoice_contract <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID>
```

Replace:
- `<POOL_CONTRACT_ID>` with the pool contract ID
- `<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with your account public key
- `<USDC_TOKEN_ID>` with the testnet USDC token ID (or deploy your own mock token)
- `<INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID>` with the invoice contract ID

### Verify Deployment

You can verify contracts are deployed and initialized by reading their state:

```bash
# Check invoice contract initialization
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_config

# Check pool contract state
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <POOL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_config
```

If both return data (no errors), your contracts are deployed and initialized.

### View Deployment on Explorer

Visit the Stellar Expert explorer to confirm your deployment:

- **Testnet**: https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/<CONTRACT_ID>

Replace `<CONTRACT_ID>` with the actual contract ID to view the contract details.

### Use Deployed Contracts in Frontend

Update your frontend `.env.local` with the deployed contract IDs:

```bash
# In frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID=<INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID>
NEXT_PUBLIC_POOL_CONTRACT_ID=<POOL_CONTRACT_ID>
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_TOKEN_ID=<USDC_TOKEN_ID>
```

Then restart the frontend dev server: `npm run dev`

## 🔐 Security Checklist

**Before submitting a PR with smart contract changes, review and check off the following security items.** This checklist helps catch common vulnerabilities and ensures code quality.

### Authorization & Access Control

- [ ] All state-changing functions require proper authorization with `.require_auth()`
- [ ] Admin-only functions are guarded by checking against a stored admin address
- [ ] Pool-only functions verify the caller is the registered pool contract
- [ ] No auth bypass—authorization checks cannot be skipped or circumvented
- [ ] Auth is checked BEFORE state mutations (not after)

### Input Validation

- [ ] All numeric inputs (amounts, rates, delays) are validated for reasonable bounds
- [ ] Zero or negative amounts are rejected where they shouldn't be allowed
- [ ] Addresses are validated before use (e.g., not checking against empty addresses)
- [ ] Due dates are validated to be in the future for invoices
- [ ] Token addresses are validated to be whitelisted or registered

### Reentrancy & State Safety

- [ ] Functions follow the Check-Effects-Interactions pattern:
  - **Check**: Validate inputs and authorization first
  - **Effects**: Update internal state
  - **Interactions**: Call external contracts last
- [ ] No dangerous nested calls that could re-enter the contract
- [ ] Idempotency guards (e.g., `executed` or `paid` flags) prevent duplicate execution
- [ ] Events are emitted consistently for all state changes

### Integer Arithmetic

- [ ] Overflow and underflow are not possible (Rust enforces this in release mode, but reason through math)
- [ ] Interest calculations use appropriate precision (avoid losing funds due to rounding)
- [ ] Checked arithmetic operations (`.checked_add()`, `.checked_sub()`, `.checked_mul()`) for complex operations
- [ ] Division by zero is impossible (divisors are validated to be > 0)

### Storage & Data Integrity

- [ ] All mutable storage reads (`env.storage().instance().get()`) are followed by validation
- [ ] Storage keys are defined in a `DataKey` enum to avoid collisions
- [ ] Critical data (balances, permissions) is stored durably, not transiently
- [ ] Data migrations (if any) maintain consistency and don't corrupt state

### Error Handling & Recovery

- [ ] Errors are clear and descriptive (help developers debug)
- [ ] `panic!()` is used for contract errors; messages are concise
- [ ] No silent failures—failed operations are explicitly rejected
- [ ] Recovery paths are tested (e.g., what happens if a withdrawal fails?)

### Cryptography & Secrets

- [ ] No private keys, seed phrases, or secrets hardcoded in the contract
- [ ] All signing is delegated to Stellar's transaction signing mechanism
- [ ] Contract does not attempt to implement custom cryptography
- [ ] Nonces or timestamps are only used with explicit purpose and validation

### Testing & Coverage

- [ ] New functions include unit tests covering happy path + edge cases
- [ ] Edge cases are explicitly tested (zero amounts, max values, boundary conditions)
- [ ] Fuzz tests pass without panicking on random inputs
- [ ] Integration tests verify multi-contract interactions
- [ ] Authorization tests verify unauthorized callers are blocked

### Code Quality

- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes (no warnings)
- [ ] `cargo fmt` has been run (consistent code formatting)
- [ ] `cargo audit` reports no critical or high-severity dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Comments explain non-obvious logic, especially around security-critical code
- [ ] No useless clones, allocations, or performance issues flagged by Clippy

### Configuration & Constants

- [ ] Magic numbers (rates, caps, limits) are defined as named `const` values at the module level
- [ ] Default yield rate and factoring fees are capped and validated
- [ ] Timelock durations are appropriate for mainnet (typically 24+ hours)
- [ ] All constants are documented with their purpose and unit

### Event Logging

- [ ] All state-changing operations emit clear events
- [ ] Events include relevant indexed topics (contract, user, invoice_id, etc.)
- [ ] Events are emitted AFTER state changes to maintain consistency
- [ ] Events are queryable and useful for frontend and monitoring

## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### Rust (Smart Contracts)

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Formatter** | `cargo fmt` — run before every commit |
| **Linter** | `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` — no warnings allowed |
| **`#![no_std]`** | All contracts must be `no_std` compatible |
| **Naming** | `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types/enums |
| **Error handling** | Use `panic!("descriptive message")` for contract errors; keep messages concise and helpful |
| **Events** | Use `symbol_short!` for event topics; publish events for all state-changing operations |
| **Storage keys** | Define all keys in the `DataKey` enum to prevent collisions |
| **Authorization** | Always call `.require_auth()` on the relevant `Address` before mutating state |
| **Constants** | Use `const` for fixed values (e.g. `DEFAULT_YIELD_BPS`, `SECS_PER_YEAR`) with uppercase names |

### TypeScript (Frontend)

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Formatter** | Prettier (runs automatically via `lint-staged` on commit) |
| **Linter** | ESLint with `eslint-config-next` and `@typescript-eslint` |
| **Framework** | Next.js 14 App Router — use `'use client'` directive only when needed |
| **State** | Zustand for global state (`lib/store.ts`); React hooks for local UI state |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS utility classes; follow existing `brand-*` design tokens |
| **Naming** | `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for functions/variables/hooks |
| **Imports** | Use `@/` path alias (e.g. `@/lib/store`, `@/components/Navbar`) |
| **Types** | Define shared types in `lib/types.ts`; prefer `interface` over `type` for objects |
| **Contract calls** | All Soroban interaction builders go in `lib/contracts.ts` |
| **SDK helpers** | Stellar SDK utilities in `lib/stellar.ts` |

### General Best Practices

- Keep files focused — ideally one component or module per file
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies—prefer standard library alternatives when available
- Never commit `.env.local` or secret keys to the repository
- Use English for all code comments, commit messages, and documentation
